##Things to do:


* Create a line class for checking line intersection
* Organize vector of lines for checking intersection when generating chunks
* Create a point class for converting easily from p2t::Point and sf::Vector2<T>
* Gravity...
* Create polygon class to be used in chunk
* Procedural level generation
* Grass drawing on top of chunks
